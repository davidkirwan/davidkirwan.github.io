    "summary": "Hi my name is David Kirwan, I am a recent computing postgraduate from the Waterford Institute of Technology, and currently based in Waterford City, Ireland. I am an avid supporter of open source software / hardware and I have huge interest in STEM/STEAM(A - Art) fields in general. I'm particularly Interested in the maker movement, where I enjoy building interactive prototypes using embedded system such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I'm a member of the local makerspace the South East Makerspace (SEMS) and have been involved in several projects. See the [[b;#ffffff;#000]projects] command for a list of my projects.\n\nTime permitting, I also like to get involved in amateur astronomy and amateur radio. I maintain a 20.1MHz dual dipole antenna array and software defined radio receiver. I passed my CEPT Class 2 amateur radio licence exam in 2017 (callsign: EI-7HTB). In the near future I hope to pursue a Ph.D program in an Astronomy/Computing field.",
